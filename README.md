Computes the fugacity coefficient, compressibility, and density of a gas using the Peng-Robinson Equation of State.

Enter the parameters (Tc,Pc,\omega) = (critical temperature, critical pressure, accentric factor) for your molecule in the script.

As an example, to find the properties at 298.0 K and 65.0 bar, run the script in the terminal as:
python PREOS.py 298.0 65.0
